For this project we split the work and each worked on a bit of everything. We used google for help with items specifically Unreal Engine forums and guides.

### Meeting times:
We met every friday during our lab time to discuss the assignment and make sure we knew what needed to be done. As well as communicated throughout the rest of the week over messages for the same reasons.
